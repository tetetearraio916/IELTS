## Leisure Facilities

### Would people change their way of entertainment as they grow older?

In my opinion, the way we enjoy things changes with age.
I believe that by gradually shifting to a new way of perceiving things and values that were not possible when we were younger, we will discover our own identity and be able to enjoy life in a positive way that suits our age.

### What do young people do for fun?

Young people have developed various ways to have fun. In "online drinking parties," which are gaining acceptance among a wide range of generations, participants send each other items from Amazon and other sites in advance. The value of the online drinking party is enhanced by the surprise of opening the packages at the same time.

### Do you think entertainment methods will be home-based in the future?

In my opinion, real life and online will be used in a more balanced way in the future.
Recently, I heard that young people are using letters to communicate with their parents and grandparents. For example, when a mask arrives from a grandparent with no sign of an end to the infection. At such times, they write letters to their grandparents saying, "This is the time to express our gratitude. They use analog methods to convey the "feelings" that cannot be solved by technology.

### What kinds of leisure facilities are popular in your country?

One of the most popular leisure facilities is Tokyo Disneyland. The reason why this facility is so popular is that it can be enjoyed by both children and adults, and it has been created with a world view that will make you forget your daily life.

### Do you think itâ€™s important to take some time off work or study and do some leisure activities?
I think the reason we are born is not to work or study, but to have fun, so I think it is very important to play.
People naturally become absorbed in things that they can genuinely enjoy without worrying about their surroundings, to the point of losing track of time, and this state is known as the "flow state.
When a swimmer set a new Japanese record, he said, "I was very relaxed and could swim naturally without any negative feelings. When an athlete sets a good record or makes a great play, they are often in this state. So it is very important to play in order to develop the ability to actively take charge of one's life, just like those people who frequently feel the flow state by engaging in something immersive on a daily basis.
