### Do you study in a university?
I am a senior in college, majoring in Applied Science.

### Do you prefer to study alone or with other students? Why?
I like to study alone. I can concentrate more quietly when I'm alone.

### What are the advantages of studying with your friends?
I think the advantage of studying with friends is that you can share what you don't understand by outputting what you have input.

### Is there any equipment which helps you to study?
I find it easier to study in cafes. This is because if the place is completely quiet like a library, I would be overly cautious because of that, so I can concentrate better with a little noise like a cafe.

### What do you find the most difficult in your major?
I had the most difficulty in writing the discussion in the experiment report. The reason is that even though there is no obvious right or wrong answer, if you do not write a good discussion, you will not get credit.

### What do you have to do with your classmates?
Relationships among classmates are good. However, it has become difficult to see each other in the corona vortex.

### What do you want to do in the future?
I want to be a developer of it services in the future. So from next year, I'm going to study computer science in Canada.

### What grades do you usually get?
In my first and second year of college, I didn't study very well and played around, so I got bad grades, but since my third year, I've been studying hard and getting good grades.
