## Famous person/Celebrity

### How do people become famous?

In my view, To become famous, people must master what they are good at and what they want to do, and spread it to the world.<br>
This is because if you make a great achievement, many people will talk about the impression they have of you, and it will naturally spread to many different people. <br>
For example, famous athletes, movie directors, and artists have become famous because they have continued to move the hearts of many people.<br>
So, to become famous, people have to have a trick.

### What types of people become famous in your country?

In my country, actors, comedians, artists, and athletes are celebrities.<br>


### What qualities do (all or most or many) famous people have in common?

The common denominator of famous people is that they are experts in one thing. This is because when you go out into the world, people who can do everything are less likely to be chosen, and people who are experts in one thing are always more talented. For example, Einstein was able to become famous for his special theory of relativity because he focused on one subject, physics, and studied it. Therefore, the common denominator of celebrities is that they are single-minded people.


### Do you think people are famous as a result of some real talent or are they famous for some other reasons?

As far as I'm concerned,ã€€The entertainment industry is a world of complete realism.This is because being a celebrity is about being more eye-catching than the average person.
