## Service

### What kinds of service are not good?

It is not a good idea to end a conversation with a stop word.
This is because they do not show any desire to be close to the other person.
For example, they are words that do not develop into anything, such as "I can't do it," "I don't understand," "It's not the same," and "There is no such thing. 
A service that does not offer an alternative means of getting closer to the customer's wishes is a bad service.

### How do you deal with impolite waiters?
If there is a rude waiter, I will calmly insist that he not be violent. There are a few people who argue emotionally, but that may make the other waiter not listen to me more, so I respond as I mentioned earlier because I want him to listen to me for his rude behavior.


### Do you think that all the waiters should be given training classes?

I think they should, because the waiters who work in the best restaurants have a completely different way of doing their job than other waiters.
For example, a waiter in a top-notch restaurant can memorize each customer's menu, as well as the degree of cooking, special orders, order, etc., without even taking notes. It's easy to say that they are professionals, but it's not so easy to do. So, I think it is necessary to have training classes to become one.

### Would you like to work in the service industry in the future?

 I don't think so at all, because relationship problems can be the biggest source of stress for me.
 I used to work part-time in a restaurant, but I had a lot of trouble with customers because of the language used, minor misbehaviors, and the fact that different management teams insisted on different things, so I never want to work in the service industry again.
 

### Why do some older people want to be waiters in the bug cities?

I thought that the elderly waiters might have wanted to work in a bigger city because they were more experienced and therefore paid more.
The bigger the city, the more people are thriving and the more responsive the management wants to hire. Also, experienced old people want money too, so supply and demand match. Therefore, there are many old people who want to be waiters in big cities.
