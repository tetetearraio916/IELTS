## cause and effect

### How does advertising influence what people choose to buy?

In my opinion, advertising stimulates consumers' desire and influences their consumption behavior. In the past, Pepsi-Cola used famous artists in its commercials to steal market share from Coca-Cola, and during the diet boom, Pepsi advertised that it was lower in calories. It temporarily overtook Coca-Cola, which had the number one market share. Advertising can change the common sense and impressions of consumers and incite their purchasing consciousness.


### How has the media changed the way we get and share the news?

The means of obtaining news continues to change with the development of technology to best suit individual tastes and preferences. In the past, the only way to get news was through radio or television, depending on the convenience of the news provider, but in recent years, with the glowth of smartphones and the Internet, news can be accessed at any time.

### How has technology changed the way we work?
With the introduction of technology, the way we work has gradually changed. With the development of machines, there is no longer a need for direct manual manufacturing with the help of humans alone. Also, the development of the Internet has made it possible to work from any place and at any time.


### What are the drawbacks if the children are looked after by their grandparents?

The disadvantage of grandparents raising their grandchildren is that they may over indulge them. In some cases, they are so cute that they give their children too many different kinds of snacks, which can lead to obesity and children who don't listen to their parents anymore!
