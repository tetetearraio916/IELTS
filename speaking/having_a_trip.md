## Having a trip

### What do you need to consider while making a travel plan?

As far as I'm concerned, people have to decide tha purpose of the trip, where to go, what you want to do, prioritizing and travel expences.
The reason is that they won't have to get lost, their bugget will be clear, and they will have a destination to enjoy efficiently.
For example, they may find that the place they want to visit is not open during the season, they may not have enough time to look around, or they may overspend their bugget.
So, as I mentioned earlier, it is important to prepare in advance.

### Some people think travel experience depends on how much you spend, do you agree?

I disagree with this.
This is because I believe that what is important in a travel experience is not so much what you do where, but who you do it with.
For example, when you go on a trip, you may be touched by the kindness of passers-by who give you directions, offer hospitality, or take your picture.
There are moments when your heart is softened by the warmth of a stranger, aren't there? I believe that people travel in search of human contact when they are tired of the strictures of everyday human relationships.

### Do you prefer to stay at home or go travelling during holidays?

I prefer to go out on holidays, because it prevents me from getting stuck in the rut of my daily life. 
For example, I do it to change my mood because life would be boring if I stay in the routing for classes and homework every weekday.

### Do you like to travel with a group or on your own?
I prefer to travel alone because I am free to do whatever I want during the trip. With a large group of people, you have to move in accordance with the people around you, so you can't do what you want.
If you have to force yourself to travel, it will not be a good memory if you are not good at it.
However, if you are traveling alone, you can move at your own pace and in your own mood, so you can be flexible with your actions along the way.
For those who want to move freely, traveling alone is highly recommended.
