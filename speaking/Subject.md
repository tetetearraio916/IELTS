## Subject

### What subjects are practical in everyday life?

I'm sure that the most useful subject is English in people's life.<br>
This is because the amount and quality of information you can get is far different.<br>
For example, if you want to read the latest academic papers, most of them are in English, and you have to wait until someone translates them to read them in your own language.<br>
For this reason, English is the most practical subject for living.


### Do you think students should have the right to choose the subject they want to study in university?

Yes, I think so.<br>
This is because the more we study, the more we understand what we want to do, and what we want to learn will change each time.<br>
For example, I myself majored in applied science before I entered university, but I changed my mind about what I wanted to do while I was there and am now trying to change my major to computer science.

### What kinds of new subjects would emerge in the future?

I expect to see more software-related subjects in the future.<br>
This is because the age of IT will continue to grow and more engineers will be needed.<br>
For example, programming classes have been added to elementary school education in Japan due to the expected shortage of IT engineers in the future.<br>
So, more IT-related subjects will be added and diversified.

### What subjects are less practical in everyday life?

I possibly think the one subject that is not practical in our daily lives is ancient texts.<br>
This is because overall, there are few jobs that use ancient texts.<br>
I think it is very important to study the classics as an education in order to understand the true nature of people, which has been handed down from ancient times to the present, but I have doubts about the inclusion of the classics as a compulsory subject today because few people understand the merits of the classics until they have gained a certain level of experience.

### Do you think that science subjects are more useful than the other subjects?

I don't think so, because the subjects that are useful to a person will change depending on what he or she wants to do.<br>
For example, if you want to be a professional such as an engineer or a doctor, I think it is a very important subject, but for a general job, it is not really necessary. <br>
So, I don't think science is the most useful subject.
