I would like to tell you about Apple's Airpods
It was an advertisement for that product I saw when I watched the video of Apple's product launch.
There are several reasons whyã€€I like this product.
First of all, I needed a new pair of earphones because the ones I was using were broken.
Second,The Airpod was a revolutionary feature at the time, because it blocked out the sounds around it.
Last but not least,I went to the store and listened to it, then bought it immediately.
For these reasons, after all, the Apple AirPods were the best compared to other noise-canceling earphones.
