## Past

### How has teaching changed in your country over the past few decades?

In my opinion, the last few decades in Japan have brought to light issues such as low levels of learning awareness and time spent learning outside of school, a shift away from learning, an increase in the number of people with low proficiency levels, and the academic achievement gap.
In the 20th century, educational methods focused on academic achievement, but since the 21st century, educational methods have changed to respect each individual student. <br>

### How have advertisements changed since you were a child?

As far as I'm concerned, with the development of the Internet, advertising seems to be changing dramatically.<br>

### Do you think people are less willing to cook meals by themselves these days, compared to the past?

I believe that the number of people who cook for themselves will continue to decrease. <br>
This is because today, compared to the past, there are more delicious foods such as lunchboxes, frozen foods, and instant foods that are better than cooking by yourself, and the development of food delivery services such as Uber Eats allows people to eat restaurant food at home.,

### How has art changed in the last few decades in your country?

In my opinion, in the past few decades, many paintings and other works of art seemed to be based on political or religious ideas, but in recent years, they seem to have become more diverse.<br>
Today, many of these works are not only paintings or sculptures, but also use modern technology.<br>
