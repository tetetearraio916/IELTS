## future


### What do you think will happen to historic places or buildings in the future? Why? 

I suppose that only a very few historical legacies will remain in the future.
The legacy still survives nowadays.
For example, Gyobekli Tepe, the world's oldest archaeological site is approximately 12,000 years old.
Also,UNESCO has registered the site as a World Heritage Site and is trying to preserve it for future generations.


### How do you think will people get their news in the future? 

In my view, people will be able to have more ways to watch the news.
This is because the development of technology has diversified the means of information transmission.
For instance, not so long ago, the only way to get information was through TV, newspapers and radio, 
but there has been an increase in news through networks and social networking sites in recent years.
So, In the future, as technology develops, there will be even more ways to get information.


### Do you think the types of sport that are popular will change in the future? 

As far as Iâ€™m concerned, there will be slight changes in popular sports.
The relationship between society and sports seems to represent the state of the world.
For example, baseball is still a popular sport in Japan, but it is expected to decline. 
This is because the mentality and impersonal way of thinking that Japanese corporate organizations used to demand matched the sport of baseball.
However, in the future, immersive coercion will no longer fit into society.
Therefore, the popular sports are anticipated to change slightly.


### How do you see tourism changing in your country in the future? 

I think that Japan will become a country that specializes more in tourism, 
because it is a country with a history that is unparalleled in the world, and it has many tourist attractions. 
In addition, the yen will continue to weaken, so the number of foreign tourists will increase as the corona comes to an end.


### Do you think that in the future people will do most of their shopping using the internet? Why? / Why not? 

I think that's what's going to happen. 
This is because you can save time and effort rather than actually going to see the products. 
Also, online advertising will become more mainstream, and the number of people who are guided by it will continue to increase.
