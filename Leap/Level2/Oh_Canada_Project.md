## Saskatchewan

My name is Nobuteru Arai.<br>
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak about myself here.<br>
Let me tell you about tourism and economic business of Saskatchewan.<br>
Okay, everyone. <br>
What do you think there is to see on Saskatchewan? Nothing? <br>
Are you making fun of the countryside? <br>
No, It's a very nice place.<br>
<br>
If you go to Regina, you will be able to enjoy many things.<Br>
Regina is one of the cities in Saskatchewan.<br>
First of all, if you want to see the animals that live in Saskatchewan, you should go to the Royal Saskatchewan Museum.<br>
There are many specimens there, including priarie dogs and other animals.<br>
Moreover, there is a park called Waskana Centra, which is a very beautiful place.<br>
It used to be made in dry grasslands by damming streams, but it's now made of an artificial lake, island, and trees.<br>
Plus, you'll get to see some interesting stuff. <br>
There is the Canadian cavalry dressed in red. <br>
The Mountie is called the RCMP and is recognized as the national police force of Canada.<br>
The school that trains the Mountie is in Regina.<br>
There will be a festival called the Sunset Retreat Ceremony, where the Mountie will perform a variety of marching, drumming, and shouting of orders.<br>
  
It's not just Regina.<br>  
There are more places to visit.<br>
The city of moose jaw is located near Regina.<br>
There is a large training area for jet planes, and an air show called Canadian Snowbirds, which shows off some very acrobatic moves.<br>
If you can't see it live, you can watch them on video at the Western Development Museum.<br>

That’s it. Thank you.
