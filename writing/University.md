## Universities should allocate the same amount of money to students' sports activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree?


These days, many universities give a plethora of students money to support their activities. 
Whether academic insitution has to distribute a myriad of money to athletic activities as well as their libraries is a controversial issue.
From my point of view, I disagree with spending too much money on sport activities for undergraduate.

Firstly, it is ovious that many universities that are commited to strengthening their sports programs admit students through sports recommendations, and several of these students graduate without college-level academic skills.
The reason why this happens is because universities want to make a good impression in order to attract more students.
As a result, more and more students are neglecting their studies and devoting themselves solely to sports, and some universities are actually tacitly accepting this, as long as their sports performance has a positive impact on the university's publicity.
However, sports are only a means of education, and the main focus of a university should be academics.
So, universities invest a lot of money in sports for their students.

On the other hand, the library will have a positive impact because it is a facility that helps undergraduate students with their academic work.
It is not uncommon for academic terms and knowledge to be unavailable even if you look for them on the Internet, so a university library with specialized books and journals should be more expensive for a university whose main purpose is academics.

In summary, Universities should look back and rethink the reason for their existence, which should not be to increase the value of the university's existence through sports, but to better support the actions that should raise academic performance for their students.
