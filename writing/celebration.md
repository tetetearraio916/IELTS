## Governments spend a lot of money on public celebrations such as national  holidays and public festivals. Some people say that the government spends too  much on this and that they should use this money on other useful things. Do you  agree or disagree with the statement? 

&nbsp; It is accepted that each country has special days to celebrate the anniversary of founding the state and public fete. 
Whether nations should devote so much money to do a variety of festivals or more useful problems is a controversial issue.
My view is that I agree with spending money on celebration, for the following reasons.

&nbsp; One reason for this that it is a grate day to relieve the stress of every day.
More specifically, Festivals allow us to experience things we wouldn't normaly feel, and through the connections we make with people, they enrich our lives.
For example, in japan, it is also an opportunity for Japanese people, who usually have an image of being serious and diligent, to unleash their energy. 
During festivals, people are very open and often interact in a way that is only possible at that time.
Therefore, it is necessary that governments should financially support ocations for people to relieve their stress.

&nbsp; Besides, Celebrations also a part of our community contribution activities. 
They can also be a way to contribute to the local community, as they may attract more people from outside the area, which may help the tourism industry in the area. 
In fact, there is a famous festival in my hometown that has been attracting more and more tourists in recent years. 
In addition, it has led to an increase in the population of my hometown in the last 10 years, which has revitalized the area.

&nbsp; In conclusion, Financially supporting festivals will change people's lives for the better, and also return benefits to governments by making areas more exciting.
Meanwhile, we should not ignore there are many other things to spend money on besides festivals. 
By doing so, we can ensure that　it will enrich countries from ancient times to the present and from now to the future.
