## Giving gifts to friends and family should not be encouraged, because money is  often wasted on things that people do not like or want. Do you agree or disagree? 

&nbsp; It is generally accepted that a lot of persons gives each other at things such as celebrations and etiquet. 
Wheter people don't have to send presents that indivisuals don't need for someone due to going to waste is a controversy issue.
I disagree with not giving anything to someone just because they might not need it.


&nbsp;　I think that furnishing gifts is also good for you.
Have you ever heard of the law of reciprocity?
It refers to the psychology of wanting to "return" a favor received from another person. 
In Japan, there are events such as Valentine's Day and White Day. On Valentine's Day, there is a culture of giving out "giri-choco," which is a kind of "thank you" gift. 
In addition, it is a common custom to give chocolates in return for receiving them on White Day.
Therefore, it is highly likely that the gift will be returned to you and it will be for your own good.


&nbsp;　Moreover, the culture of gift-giving increases the willingness of consumers to buy things, which in turn stimulates the economy of the company, the region and the country.
As I mentioned earlier, Valentine's Day is said to be the result of an advertising strategy of a chocolate company. 
Nowadays, chocolate is a popular snack, and every year on that day, many chocolates are prominently displayed in stores, and many consumers can be seen buying them.
Futhermore, the custom of buying things for someone improves the economy and enriches people's lives.



&nbsp;　In conclusion, it is obvious that giving gifts is a good thing because it will have a positive effect back on you and also benefit society as a whole.
Meanwhile, we should ignore those who say that we don't need to give gifts because they are useless.
By doing so, we can ensure that we can have a positive impact on society as a whole.
