## These days, we are seeing an increasing amount of violence on television, and  this is having a negative impact on children‟s behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?

### Intro
In recent years, the genres of TV programs have been diversifying, with more and more extream content to be considered more interesting by people.
Whether children are being badly affected by the increace of violent scene on TV is controversial issue.
In my view, I agree that this is a bad influence.

### Body1
Firstly, there is no doubt that children who see a lot of violent scenes tend to become more aggressive.
This is because young children, who have difficulty distinguishing between the real and the virtual, feel fear.
Young children may perceive what they see on the screen as if it were happening in reality. Scenes of people being stabbed or bleeding in front of them can be frightening and traumatizing even for adults, but watching brutal scenes can be very shocking and frightening for young children who have difficulty distinguishing between the real world and the virtual world.


### Body2
Moreover, Only violent scenes will leave an impression on children, causing aggressive feelings.
When a young child, who does not have much understanding of the story, is exposed to a strong stimulus such as a violent scene, only that scene will remain in his or her mind. If the child imitates the violent scene or language, or encounters a similar scene, he or she may become angry or aggressive, or try to act out, without being able to make a clear judgment of right and wrong.


### Conclusion
In summary, so many things exist in this way that can have a negative impact on children.
Meanwhile, We should ignore the opinion that children are not affected by the content of TV and other media.
By doing so, we can ensure that　hildren can also be given a strong sense of ethics.
