## Compare and Contrast

### Do you think should primary school students leran a second langage or should they wait until secondary school?

I think that elementary school students have to learn a second langageã€€as soon as possible.<br>
The reason is that the ability to recognize the sounds of the language is easier to aquire at an earier age.<br>
For example, in my country, many people who started English after reaching at a certain age find it difficult to be aware of the difference between R and L sounds.<br> 
So, primary shool students should study a foreign langeage.

### Should government in a country focus more on rail transports or road transports?

What I think people should focus more on is transportation for trains. 
Developing public transportation and increasing the number of people using trains instead of cars would lead to fewer accidents.<br>
In recent years, the ageing of the populataion has been active in rural areas, and the number of accidents involving elderly people in cars seems to be incresing.<br>
Trains are less likely to cause accidents due to mistakes in driving than cars, so I thought that more emphasis should be placed on train transportation.

### Why do you some people enjoy looking at paintings and sculptures and others do not?

In my view, The difference between those who enjoy art and those who don't is whether or not they have encountered works that match their values.<br>
For instance, When people eat food, whether they like it or not, they feel some kind of taste. The same is true for art appreciation. When they see a work of art, they must have some kind of impression of it, whether they like it or not.<br>
And whether or not that impression is connected to their own sense of value is what makes the difference between those who enjoy art and those who do not.

### What is the difference between white collar and blue collar jobs?
Blue-collar workers are those who are engaged in production processes and on-site work at production sites in the manufacturing and construction industries. In contrast, white-collar workers are those who wear suits and are mainly engaged in office work.

### What is the difference between clothes that young people and old people like to wear?

The difference in fashion between the young and the old seems to be largely due to the different trends of each era.<br>
For example, I thought there was something peculiar about the way old people dressed, but when I looked at photos of the old people when they were younger, I saw that they wore the same kind of clothes. <br>
Therefore, I thought that people might be wearing the same clothes they wore when they felt they were in their prime.
